## ðŸ§  What I Learned

### Mastering the X-Axis & Basic Math Concepts
During the development of this game, I deepened my understanding of essential math concepts, particularly when it comes to:

- **Movement along the x-axis**: Learning to control characters and objects smoothly across the screen.
- **Basic math**: Working with velocity, distance calculations, and basic trigonometry to simulate motion and physics within the game world.

### Battling TypeScript: Types and Errors
TypeScriptâ€™s type-checking threw several challenges my way, especially when I was deploying the game on Vercel. However, I learned a lot from these struggles:

- **Identifying types in TypeScript**: How to understand error messages and debug issues involving types.
- **Explicitly defining types**: Realizing the importance of defining types in advance to avoid runtime problems, particularly with Phaser and other libraries.

## ðŸŽ® Level 2 in Progress: New Features Coming Soon!
Level 2 will introduce falling objects, and the level will progressively go upwards as you collect coins!
